Evidence: Shell command shows improper quoting: /usr/local/bin/opencode run 'Check my Google Calendar for tomorrow'\\''s meetings...' The issue is the message is being split into multiple arguments instead of being treated as a single quoted string. Root cause likely in src/main/opencode/adapter.ts where args are constructed. Need to: 1) Fix argument quoting/escaping in adapter.ts, 2) Ensure entire message is passed as single arg or properly escaped, 3) Test with messages containing quotes, spaces, and special chars, 4) Verify --format json and other flags are properly separated","status":"open","priority":0,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"26049947+thesammykins@users.noreply.github.com","created_at":"2026-01-15T13:41:35.628581+11:00","created_by":"thesammykins","updated_at":"2026-01-15T13:41:35.628581+11:00"}
